House Price Prediction
This regression-based project involved predicting housing prices based on multiple features like location, square footage, number of rooms, and more.
I performed data preprocessing including missing value handling and feature scaling. I trained models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and XGBoost,
tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation.This project strengthened my understanding of regression modeling, feature engineering, and performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
